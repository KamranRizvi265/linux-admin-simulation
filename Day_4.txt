Tasks
Create a new, empty file named project_keys.txt inside the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
Set the permissions for this file so that only the owner has read and write access, and no one else (not even users in the same group) has any access.
Change the owner of the ~/project/phoenix_project directory and all its contents to the user dev_lead.
Change the group owner of the ~/project/phoenix_project directory and all its contents to the developers group.
Set the permissions for the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
Set a special permission(setgid) on the ~/project/phoenix_project/src directory that forces all new files and subdirectories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the src directory itself (which is developers).
